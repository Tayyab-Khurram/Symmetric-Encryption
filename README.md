# Symmetric-Encryption
This program implements a simple encryption and decryption system using the XOR operation. It allows the user to encrypt a message by XOR-ing each character of the message with a user-defined key and decrypts it using the same key. The program features a menu for selecting encryption, decryption, or exit options, ensuring a seamless interaction. This XOR-based encryption demonstrates the simplicity of symmetric key cryptography while emphasizing the importance of using the same key for both encryption and decryption.
